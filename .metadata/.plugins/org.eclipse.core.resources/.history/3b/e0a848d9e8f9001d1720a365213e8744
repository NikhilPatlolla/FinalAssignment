		 * KEYPOINTS: CONSTRUCTOR
		 * 
		 * Certainly! Here are some key points about constructors in Java:
		 * 
		 * Constructors are special methods in a class that are used to
		 * initialize objects of that class. They have the same name as the class and do
		 * not have a return type, not even `void`.
		 * 
		 * Constructors are automatically invoked when an
		 * object of a class is created using the `new` keyword. They ensure that the
		 * object is properly initialized before it can be used.
		 * 
		 * Like regular methods, constructors can be overloaded. This
		 * means a class can have multiple constructors with different parameters,
		 * allowing objects to be initialized in different ways.
		 * 
		 * If a class does not explicitly define any
		 * constructors, Java provides a default constructor with no parameters. It
		 * initializes member variables to their default values (e.g., `0` for numeric
		 * types, `null` for reference types). Else, it uses the constructor from the Object class. 
		 * 
		 * Constructors can have access modifiers (`public`,
		 * `private`, `protected`, or default) to control their visibility. This
		 * determines whether they can be accessed by other classes or only within the
		 * same package.
		 * 
		 * If a constructor does not explicitly invoke another
		 * constructor using `this()` or `super()`, the compiler inserts a call to the
		 * default (parameterless) constructor of the superclass (`super()`), or the
		 * call to another constructor in the same class (`this()`), as the first
		 * statement of the constructor.
		 * 
		 * 7. Inheritance and Superclass Constructor: A constructor in a subclass must
		 * either call a constructor in the superclass using `super()`, or the
		 * superclass must have a default constructor. If neither condition is met, the
		 * compiler will throw an error.
		 * 
		 * 8. Instance Initialization Block: Apart from constructors, classes can also
		 * have instance initialization blocks. These blocks are executed when an object
		 * is created, before the constructor is invoked. They are useful for performing
		 * additional initialization tasks.
		 * 
		 * 9. Constructor Chaining: Constructors can call other constructors in the same
		 * class using `this()` for constructor chaining. This allows one constructor to
		 * reuse the code of another constructor in the same class.
		 * 
		 * 10. Initialization Parameters: Constructors accept parameters that are used
		 * to initialize the instance variables of an object. These parameters help
		 * customize the object's initial state during creation.
		 * 
		 * Understanding constructors is essential for proper object initialization and
		 * ensuring the correct state of objects in Java programs. They provide a way to
		 * set initial values and perform necessary setup tasks before objects can be
		 * used effectively.
