		 * However, when creating instances of these shapes, we assign them to variables of the Shape type. This allows us to utilize polymorphism.

			By treating all shape objects as instances of the Shape interface, we can invoke the calculatePerimeter() method on each object without needing to know the specific shape. 
			This enables us to write more flexible and scalable code, as we can easily add new shapes that implement the Shape interface without modifying the code that uses these shapes.
