Key Points:


Abstract Class:
An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated and is typically used as a base for other classes.
It can have both abstract and non-abstract methods.
Abstract methods are declared without an implementation and must be overridden by the subclasses.
Abstract classes can have constructors, instance variables, and concrete methods with implementations.
A class can extend only one abstract class.





Interface:
An interface is a blueprint of a class that defines a set of methods that implementing classes must implement.
It cannot have constructors or instance variables.
All methods in an interface are abstract by default, and classes implementing the interface must provide the method implementations.
A class can implement multiple interfaces.


An abstract class allows both abstract and non-abstract methods, 
while an interface only allows abstract methods (default methods were introduced in Java 8).


Abstract classes can have constructors and instance variables, while interfaces cannot.


A class can extend only one abstract class, but it can implement multiple interfaces.


Abstract classes provide a way to share code and common behavior among related classes, 
while interfaces provide a contract that implementing classes must adhere to.

Abstract classes are useful when we want to create a base class with some default behavior, 
while interfaces are useful for defining a common behavior that multiple unrelated classes can implement.

An abstract class can be considered as a "is-a" relationship, while an interface can be considered as a "has-a" relationship.
